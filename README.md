# Bitcoin Puzzle Adventures

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puzzleman22/Bitcoin-Puzzle-Adventures/refs/heads/main/BPA.png" />

an isometric game where you have to enter rooms and try to solve the bitcoin puzzle

in every room a each tile is bit, and they all form a binary string for a specific puzzle

multiple transformations are applied when tile is changed, so this increases the chances to find the right key

good luck!

## How to run?

`python start.py`
